## We have two functions here which help in caching the inverse of a matrix 
## rather than compute it repeatedly. makeCachematrix will create a special matrix object 
## that can cache its inverse.  cachesolve retrieves the inverse from the cache if available, 
## else calculates and sets the inverse to cache

## This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse.

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
  i <- NULL
  set <- function(y) {
    x <<- y
    i <<- NULL
  }
  get <- function() x
  setinverse <- function(inverse) i <<- inverse
  getinverse <- function() i
  list(set = set, get = get,
       setinverse = setinverse,
       getinverse = getinverse)
}


## This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by makeCacheMatrix
## above. If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), 
## then the cachesolve should retrieve the inverse from the cache.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
  ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
  i <- x$getinverse()
  if(!is.null(i)) {
    message("getting cached data")
    return(i)
  }
  data <- x$get()
  i <- solve(data)
  x$setinverse(i)
  i
}
